# Local Library Application
## Summary
* Assembled the functionality for an application that allows users to search, review and check out books from their local neighborhood.
* Created search and sorting functions to allow users to know what books were available and their rating.
* Coded using JavaScript functions that are built to enable the expansion of the library with little to no need for code refactoring.
Technology: JavaScript ES6, Bootstrap, HTML5, Node.js

## Details
This project was primarily created to demonstrate my understanding of JavaScript per Thinkful cirriculum.
The intention of this application is for the user to get statistics about their local library, their books, and their accounts.
Not only does it allow a user to see statistics, but it also allows them to see the returned status of books, popular authors and their ratings.
This project is currently finished, with no planned updates.
